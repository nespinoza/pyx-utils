# pyx-utils

Utilities to perform some graphics on plots using the pyx library (pyx.sourceforge.net)

About the code
--------------

This repository is work in progress. I have found the utilities that I wrote to be very useful 
for data visualization using the beautiful PyX package, whose syntax can be very messy 
sometimes; my idea is to someday unite the beautiful graphics made with PyX with the simplicity 
of usage that matplotlib offers.

Examples on how to use the routines are under the "examples" folder.

Dependencies
------------

The routines depend heavily on PyX (pyx.sourceforge.net).
